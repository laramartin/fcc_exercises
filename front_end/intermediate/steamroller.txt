Steamroller

Flatten a nested array. You must account for varying levels of nesting.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

Here are some helpful links:
- Array.isArray()

steamrollArray([[["a"]], [["b"]]]) should return ["a", "b"].
steamrollArray([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]) should return [1, 2, 3, 4].
steamrollArray([1, [], [3, [[4]]]]) should return [1, 3, 4].
steamrollArray([1, {}, [3, [[4]]]]) should return [1, {}, 3, 4].
