Missing letters

Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it.

If all letters are present in the range, return undefined.

Remember to use Read-Search-Ask if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.

Here are some helpful links:
- String.charCodeAt()
- String.fromCharCode()

fearNotLetter("abce") should return "d".
fearNotLetter("abcdefghjklmno") should return "i".
fearNotLetter("bcd") should return undefined.
fearNotLetter("yz") should return undefined.
